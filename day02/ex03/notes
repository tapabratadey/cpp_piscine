What do you think of using a namespace instead of a class to represent 
fixed point values ? I mean, with a scoped typedef on int, we could write 
scoped functions and save\r\nthe cost of instanciations, but at the same time, 
we’d loose some handy syntax. What’s your point of view ? The bool selector 
below has no incidence on grade.
